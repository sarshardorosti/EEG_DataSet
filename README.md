## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers, students, and professionals in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), neuroscience, and related fields, providing a curated collection of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets. Covering diverse applications such as motor imagery, emotion recognition, clinical EEG analysis, and more, this list aims to facilitate reproducible research and innovation. Each dataset includes a brief description and a verified address linking to its source, ensuring accessibility and accuracy. The repository is actively maintained, and contributions to expand or update the dataset list are encouraged.

**Note**: All links have been verified as active and accessible as of June 7, 2025. Some datasets linked to articles may require contacting authors for access, and certain repositories necessitate searching for specific datasets. For the latest updates, explore platforms like OpenNeuro (Address: https://openneuro.org/) or ElectrophysiologyData (Address: https://github.com/openlists/ElectrophysiologyData).
